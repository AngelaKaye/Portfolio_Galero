		<p> My name is Angela Kaye A. Galero, and I was born on May 25, 2002, at home. I was named by a midwife who assisted my mother in giving birth to me and my twin. Yes, I have a twin sister, but she died soon after she was born in my mother's womb. My family and I were now residing in Rizal, Laguna. My father baptized me and my two brothers in a Christian church, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, in 2012. Years later, my mother became a member of our church as well. </p>
		<p> In terms of my personality, I was an introvert who seemed to be naturally quiet and shy. However, once someone got to know me well, I became really loud. As I experienced being a leader most often in college, my communication skill improved a little. However, I still have a fear of confronting and interacting with large groups of people. I often experience anxiety attacks, but I was doing everything I can to overcome this concern. </p>
